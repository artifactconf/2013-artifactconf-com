                        <p>After graduating from NYU Film School and then working in digital book publishing for two years, Sophie realized that what she really wanted to do was to design websites. She freelanced for two years before becoming a full time designer with Happy Cog, honing her skills working with clients such as Texas Monthly, the Texas Department of Transportation, and National Geographic. Her love of beautiful design is only overshadowed by her passion for websites that are simple, easily navigable, and full of necessary, applicable content. When not in front of a screen, Sophie enjoys cooking, reading, road trips, and camping. She is passionate about craft and import beer, and can talk about it for a very long time.</p>

                  <p>When approaching the design of a responsive website, old habits might focus you on sidebars and footer regions for placing content. It's natural to assume the best responsive solutions are to be found in moving those regions around the page as whole units. But that way of thinking could lead you miss the best stuff about responsive design. Let go of the old habits, and discover how focusing on content can drive far superior responsive layouts.</p>

                  <p> • Font services vs. self-hosting (smackdown-style)<br />
                    • Where they work (and where they don't)<br />

                            We ask that all workshoppers bring at least a basic understanding of HTML/CSS, a laptop, and an opinion.</p>

                      <p>As responsive web design continues to evolve, we’re confronted with difficult problems about how to create adaptive interfaces that look and function beautifully across many screen sizes and environments. How do we handle navigation that’s four levels deep? How do we deal with large data tables? How well do modules like lightboxes, tabs, embeddable maps and more translate to various contexts? </p>
                        <p>This workshop will take a detailed look at the pros, cons and considerations of many emerging responsive patterns, and will explain how to incorporate them meaningfully in your projects. You'll come away with plenty to think about and plenty to implement when you get back to work.</p>
